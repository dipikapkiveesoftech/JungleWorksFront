            â€œDeep did an amazing job as always, this time I couldn't release the
            payment due to freelancer website problems which are not resolved
            for over a month, and ID verification which I could not provide
            especially with Freelancer history of privacy violation. I informed
            Deep that I am unwilling to take a picture with a silly code and my
            ID to satisfy Freelancer requirements and he fully understood my
            concerns. The only reason I was using Freelancer.com is to deal with
            Deep and I would give him any project as he is proactive,
            understandable and the quality of his work is outstanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would apologize to Deep for any delay in finalizing his payment,
            and I would recommend him to any other employer, please find his
            work in the website below
